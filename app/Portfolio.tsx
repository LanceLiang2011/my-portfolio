            As a self-taught developer, most of the projects you will find here
            are the result of my learning experiences, tutorials, and mockups.
            However, I am excited to share that I am now starting to build
            real-world projects that I hope real users can benefit from. These
            projects will be showcased here soon after they are completed. As a
            passionate and motivated learner, I am always seeking new challenges
            and opportunities to enhance my skills and knowledge in web
            development. I believe that every project I undertake is an
            opportunity to learn and grow.
